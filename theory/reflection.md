# Reflection

I'll try and keep this retrospective concise and to the point (that's a tautology, in a way).

I definitely put a lot more effort and passion into this project than ever before in Software Design Development or previously in IST. Though in some areas I did fall short as I believe I spent more time enjoying the creation of an engine built from a set of fundamental concepts that I determined way before we even started the project. I really enjoyed building an engine capable of easily unleashing creativity and that functions logically (for me at least). Character customisation was always going to be my weak point and in the end, I left some portions of it out as I felt it wasn't up to par with the rest of my game. I could've also added more craftable items, however other features needed to be implemented and thus one of the last things I considered doing.

All in all, I enjoyed making the game, I enjoyed unleashing my programming prowess through my implementation of graphical and logical features within the game. It was fun.
